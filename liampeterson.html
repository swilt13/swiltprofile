    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>Peterson features a plus fastball that has excellent carry to it that causes batters to swing under it and pop it up very often. He combines this with a solid change up that misses bats, especially against lefties. He mixes in a slider that is another solid plus pitch that excels against right handed bats. He also mixes in an occasional curve.</p>
    <p>Peterson has improved on his control from his freshman to sophomore season at Florida. He has a good pitch mix and isn’t afraid to throw any of his pitches in any count. When he gets into trouble, he tends to rely on his fastball, which he has been able to get away with at the college level.</p>

    <h2>Pitching Mechanics</h2>
    <p>PPeterson has very smooth and easy mechanics and is able to get down the mound well in order to generate
        effortless velocity on his fastball. From the windup, Peterson brings his left knee up to almost touch his glove
        and then accelerates his lower half and glides down the mound. Peterson does an excellent job of repeating his
        mechanics on each pitch and throws from a high ¾ arm slot.</p>
    <p>He's able to keep his arm action compact and smooth while generating power from his lower half. He brings the
        ball back out of the glove instead of down, eliminating any wasted movement and allowing his upper and lower
        half to stay on time. The throwing motion is very under control and it looks easy for Peterson to create power
        with his 6-5 frame.</p>
    <h2>Arsenal</h2>
    <p>Peterson's fastball has a lot of carry and does a lot of damage high in the zone, it generates a lot of swing and
        miss and popouts. The pitch sits in the mid to high 90s but has touched 99. There is a lot of arm side run on
        the fastball that can be deceptive to hitters and allows Peterson to use this pitch to set up his change and
        slider. Peterson commands this pitch very well, he likes to keep it up in the zone but can also place it at
        hitters knees.</p>
    <p>The slider is a plus pitch that has a good two plane tilt along with late bite. The fastball-slider combo against
        right-handed batters can be lethal for Peterson and the slider generates a ton of swing and miss. Peterson needs
        to continue to keep this pitch away from righties as there have been times where he can hang it out over the
        plate.</p>
    <p>The changeup is another solid offering from Peterson. The majority of the changeups he throws are against lefties
        as this pitch gets a ton of fade on it and hitters constantly swing over this pitch.The changeup tunnels off of
        the fastball well and it is very challenging for hitters to pick up. Peterson does a great job of selling this
        pitch by keeping his arm action almost identical to his fastball. He’ll need to work on keeping the changeup
        down in the zone.</p>
    <p>The curveball is a work in progress for Peterson, but it has the potential to be an average pitch. He throws it
        with good depth and it can be effective against left-handed hitters. However, he needs to improve his
        consistency with this pitch and learn to throw it for strikes.</p>
