    <h2>Pitching Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Kramkoski throws from a low ¾ arm slot which helps him generate a good arm side run on his sinker. He starts with his glove by his chin then raises it slightly as he brings his front leg up past a 90 degree angle and close to his stomach. He gets his front leg low to the dirt as he strides down the mound and then accelerates hard off the mound with his back foot. The motion allows for good extension but his arm action can be a little late when he plants his front foot.</p>
    <p>The one thing that sticks out to me is how long Kramkowski takes to get to the plate from the stretch. This can lead to easy stolen bases at the next level and I think that he needs to work on a quicker delivery from the stretch.</p>
    <h2>Arsenal</h2>
    <p>As mentioned, the fastball has two shapes, sinker and four seam. Both sit mid 90s. The sinker has good horizontal movement and great arm side run from Kramboski's lower arm slot. The sinker works well away from hitters and Kramkoski does a good job locating the pitch and rarely misses. The four seam is an above average offering that has good carry that leads to opposing hitters swinging under the pitch if they are expecting the sinker.</p>
    <p>The slider is Kramkoski's best offering and gets great late movement. This pitch is more of a sweeping slider as it has a lot of vertical movement. He disguises the pitch and often has opposing hitters lunging at it. This pitch generates a bunch of swing and miss against both righties and lefties. He locates it very well and will throw it in any count.</p>
    <p>Kramkoski also includes a cutter in his pitch mix that sits in the high 80s. It's a solid offering and the pitch sees the majority of its usage against opposing lefties. The shape of this pitch tunnels well with the sinker and is more of a weak contact pitch rather than a swing and miss pitch. The cutter can sometimes catch too much of the zone and leads to a lot of hard hit balls coming from this pitch.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Kramkoski already displays elite control and is able to manipulate the zone with a solid arsenal of pitches. I see a lot of room for him to grow into his 6-3 lean frame and could lead to gains in velocity. I would like to see him add some sort of changeup to strengthen his approach to left handed hitter and I also think this will have a positive effect on his strikeout numbers. </p>
