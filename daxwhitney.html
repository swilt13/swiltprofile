    <h2>Pitching Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Whitney throws from a true ¾ arm slot and has a unique delivery. It almost looks like he is throwing a dart when pitching. Whitney takes the ball out of his glove and instead of bringing it down or out, he keeps it at his hip and then from there brings the ball up into layback position and gets good extension from his 6-5 frame. 
</p>
    <p>The motion looks a little whippy and I wouldn't necessarily call this a smooth delivery but it works well for Whitney. His throwing motion does not seem to take any velocity away from his pitches as he is able to stay on time when his front foot plants and there doesn’t appear to be any unnecessary stress on his shoulder.
</p>
    <h2>Arsenal</h2>
    <p>Whitney’s fastball sits 92-95 and has touched 98 mph. There is a ton of life on this pitch and it gets to the plate in a hurry with his ability to get down the mound. There is good arm side run to this pitch and Whitney is able to locate it well around the zone. The fastball has the most success up in the zone where hitters tend to swing under as Whitney generates good spin with this pitch.

</p>
    <p>The curve is almost a true 12-6 curveball that Whitney throws in the mid to low 70s. It provides a good gap of velocity in his arsenal and is hard for opposing hitters to pick up. The curve has the most success against left-handed hitters, as he struck out more than 50 lefties with this pitch in his first year. The pitch can get away from him at times and he needs to work on keeping this pitch down.
</p>
    <p>Whitney’s slider is still a work in progress and he doesn’t throw it too often. Currently, it is an average to below average breaking ball that has more vertical drop than a traditional slider and can sometimes hang up in the zone. He is still working on this pitch and it can really only get better.
</p>
    <p>The changeup for Whitney is my personal favorite. He scratched his old change and has been working on the new “kick change” ever since arriving at Oregon State. The usage isn’t high but the early returns are good. The pitch has good late movement and got better as the year went on generating more and more whiffs against both lefties and righties. I am confident that this pitch will develop into a plus pitch in his arsenal. 
</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Whitney is not a finished product as he is still growing into his tall frame but already uses solid mechanics to get to high velocities. I project him to have three plus pitches by the time he’s done at Oregon State. For most young pitchers, consistency is key for him and going into his sophomore year I would like to see him show consistent velocity with his fastballs as he gets deeper into starts.
