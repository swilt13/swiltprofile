    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>Nathan Taylor pitched 72⅔ innings as a freshman and then quickly became the Friday starter as a Sophomore, while receiving Big 12 honorable mention. He improved both his SO% and his BB% in his second year and features a fastball, slider, and a change up.</p>
    <p>Taylor’s stuff does not jump out, he doesn’t have the high velocity fastball but he is able control the count. Taylor does a good job pitching to contact and is able to work himself out of difficult situations.

    <h2>Pitching Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Nathan Taylor throws from a low ¾ arm slot and uses smooth mechanics while getting down the mound well. He uses his developed lower half to generate power and controlled arm action that allows him to go deep into games.
</p>
    <p>Taylor gets low in his delivery, being as tall as he is, to then push off the mound while his glove points straight at the catcher. He pulls his glove into his chest and lets it go up by his head, accompanied by a decent sized leg kick follow through.</p>
    <h2>Arsenal</h2>
    <p>Taylor is able to extend down the mound well and throw his fastball with tail and sink action. While he sits between the 91-94 mph range, Taylor has touched 97 in game. The shape of his fastball stays fairly consistent, but there are times where his fastballs have some cut action. Taylor is able to work this pitch all over the zone, he is able to stay outside against righties and high and away to get lefties to chase. He commands the pitch well and generates weak rollers in the infield.
</p>
    <p>The slider is the best pitch that Taylor features and can develop into a plus pitch that has generated a high whiff rate over his first two seasons. The slider has two different shapes at times. It can have great vertical drop at times and could even be mistaken for a curveball. Other times it has the classic right to left horizontal movement. Both shapes have success against hitters. Taylor tunnels this pitch well with his fastball and together the two pitches can carry him through a start. </p>
    <p>The changeup has good late drop and run action on it. This pitch has a tendency to find barrels from opposing hitters when Taylor hangs it in the zone. Since the velocity and movement is similar to his fastball, it can be easy for other teams to pick up this pitch. I would be interested to see Taylor work on a changeup that has more vertical drop, like a split change. His arm action can stay identical to his fastball and allow the grip to do all the work so that it can round out the pitch shapes in his arsenal. 
</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Taylor has a lot of positives in his game and possesses the raw tools to be successful. I believe he can tap into some more velocity with his big frame and turn his fastball into a plus pitch. He’ll need to improve his approach to left-handed hitters, which is currently a weakness in his game. The key for Taylor will be consistency and continuing to fill the strike zone and generate weak contact. With his current stuff he cannot rely on high chase rates so command for Taylor will be crucial to his success.</p>
