        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>Nathan Taylor is a 6-5, 230 pound right handed pitcher and the ace of the Bearcats pitching staff. He came onto the scene early as he pitched 72⅔ innings as a freshman and then quickly became the Friday starter as a Sophomore, while also receiving all Big 12 honorable mention. He improved both his SO% and his BB% in his second year and looks to keep that trend going. He features a fastball, slider, and a change up.</p>
        <p>Taylor’s stuff does not jump out on a page, he doesn’t have the high velocity fastball but he can control the count. Taylor does a good job pitching to contact and is able to work himself out of a jam. With another standout season at Cincinnati in his junior year, he could definitely hear his name called early come July 2026.</p>

        <h2>Pitching Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Nathan Taylor throws from a true low ¾ arm slot and uses smooth mechanics while getting down the mound well. He uses his developed lower half to generate power and a controlled arm action that allows him to go deep into games without putting copious amounts of stress on his elbow/shoulder.</p>
        <p>Taylor can get relatively low in his delivery being as tall as he is, to then push off the mound with his strong lower half while his glove points straight at the catcher. He pulls his glove into his chest and the lets it go up by his head, accompanied by a decent sized leg kick follow through.</p>
        <h2>Arsenal</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">
            <li><strong>Fastball: 91-94 mph</strong><br>Taylor's fastball may not blow hitters away with its speed, but he is able to extend down the mound well and throw this pitch with a lot of tail and some sinker action. While he sits between the 91-94 mph range, Taylor has touched 97 in games before. The shape of his fastball stays fairly consistent, but there are times where I noticed some of his fastballs have some cut action and I could not determine if this was an entirely different grip or just something that happened from time to time.  <br><br>Taylor is able to work with this pitch all over the zone, he can sneak one in on the outside against righties and dot it high and away and get lefties to chase it. He commands the pitch well and contact is usually weak rollers in the infield..</li>
            <br><li><strong>Slider: 82-85 mph</strong><br>TI would consider the slider to be the best pitch in Taylor’s arsenal as it is already showing signs of potentially being a plus pitch. It has devastating break and generates a lot of whiffs, the majority coming against right handed hitters, who will chase the slider down in the dirt.<br><br>The interesting thing about the slider is how many shapes it has. The slider can have severe drop at times and could even be mistaken for a curveball. Other times it has the classic right to left horizontal movement. Both shapes have success against hitters. Taylor tunnels this pitch well with his sinking fastball and together the two pitches can carry Taylor through a start.</li>
            <br><li><strong>Changeup: 85-87 mph</strong><br>The changeup is the third pitch in Taylor's arsenal and does have good late drop and run action on it. Taylor uses this pitch a good amount and has had success with it. This pitch has seen its share of barrels from opposing teams when Taylor gets in the habit of hanging it in the zone. Since the velocity and movement is similar to his fastball, it can be easy for other teams to pick up this pitch.<br><br>I would be interested to see Taylor work on this pitch and maybe tweak it to where it has more vertical drop. I would recommend something like a split change, where his arm action can stay identical to his fastball and allow the grip to do all the work so that it can better round out the pitch shapes in his arsenal. </li>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Taylor has many positives in his game and the raw tools to become a starter at the next level. I believe he can tap into some more velocity with his 6-5 frame and turn his fastball into a plus pitch. Going into what could be his final year at Cincinnati, he’ll need to figure out an approach to left-handed hitters, which is probably the biggest weakness in his game currently. When he is successful against lefties, it is usually a result of him working away with his fastball and changeup and tying them up with his slider.</p>
        <p>The key for Taylor's game will be consistency and continuing to fill up the strike zone to generate weak contact. With his current stuff he cannot depend on high chase rates so command for Taylor will be crucial when he starts to throw at the next level.</p>
