    <h2>Pitching Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Parker Messick throws from a ¾ arm slot. From the wind up he brings his glove up to his back ear and gets his
        knee up to the letters on his jersey. From the windup he brings his knee perpendicular to his hip and keeps his
        glove down around hip level. He explodes off the mound and gets good extension.</p>
    <h2>Arsenal</h2>
    <p>Messick throws both a 4 seam fastball and a sinker, with the 4 seam being his primary pitch. He likes to keep the
        4 seamer up in the zone and keeps his sinker lower in the zone. The 4 seamer has a noticeable cut to it allowing
        it to pair well with the arm side movement from the sinker.</p>
    <p>The changeup is the 2nd most utilized pitch behind the 4 seamer for Messick. This pitch has a lot of drop to it
        with a little tail. He uses this pitch almost exclusively against right handed batters (29% vs RHH and 5% vs
        LHH). </p>
    <p>The slider is Messick’s out pitch against lefties and he does a good job locating this pitch low in the zone. The
        slider has a good combination of horizontal and vertical movement and at times can look more like a sweeper.
    </p>
    <p>
        Messick also mixes in a curveball. In the small sample, this pitch has been effective for him, mainly against
        righties where he generates a lot of weak contact.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Parker Messick pitched well in his short MLB stint in the 2025 season where he showcased his above average
        command and ability to manipulate the zone. While he won’t blow you away with his stuff, Messick has the tools
        to stick in a major league rotation if he continues to work on his pitch mix. </p>
